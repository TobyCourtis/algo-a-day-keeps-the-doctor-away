Attempt:

Traverse tree using dfs.

1. Traverse left
2. append node.val to list
3. traverse right
4. Stop when the list is length 'k'
5. Return final element in list which is kth largets in BST

Runtime beat 53, memory 63

Optimal:

kthSmallestIterative() solution.

Same order of magnitude but slightly more performant.

Beat 84% runtime, 84% memory
