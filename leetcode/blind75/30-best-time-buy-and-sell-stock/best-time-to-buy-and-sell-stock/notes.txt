1. Failed first approach due to time limit exceeded - solution was O(n^2)
    - Failed when it came to larger test sets and had to take a different approach
2. Overly complex second attempt with poor memory/cpu performance:
    - Loop through array
    - If next value is less, move onto next
    - Compare current value to every other value onwards in the array
    - Record profit for futureValue - current and override maxProfit if it's larger than maxProfit
    - Break if next futureValue is less than current value
    - Begin again from the 'futureValue'
3. Optimal solution
    - Required re-thinking about how the problem was solved.
    - Save first price as minimum
    - Save maxProfit as 0
    - Repeat the following from index 1 to end of array:
        - If next element is smaller, then record that as the minimum
        - Else if nextElement - minimum > maxProfit then overwrite max profit
