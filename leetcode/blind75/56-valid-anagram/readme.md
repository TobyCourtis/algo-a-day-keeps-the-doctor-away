Initial thoughts:
- Fairly trivial
- Gave all the approaches I could think of an attempt
  - Double loop O(n^2)
  - Sorting O(n log n)
  - Hash table (O(n))




Optimal solution:
- Missed minor efficiency improvements (and more concise code) but the main approach was the same which is what we care about
