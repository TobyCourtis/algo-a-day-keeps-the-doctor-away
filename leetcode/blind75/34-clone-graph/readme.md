Attempt 1:

- Again didn't take into account a recursive approach which uses a global var to update the 'graph' we are building 
- Jumped straight in to the trap of a one func recursive solution

Attempt 2:

- A dfs approach which builds a node dictionary as it executes

Runtime beat 30%, memory 64%. Correct order of magnitude
