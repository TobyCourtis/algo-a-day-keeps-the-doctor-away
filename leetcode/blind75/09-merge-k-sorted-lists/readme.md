attempt:

1. implement merge 2 lists functionality from '08 merge two sorted lists' problem
2. iterate through input away, merging the lists in pairs
   1. `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5,6], [7,8]] > [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5,6,7,8]]`
3. Continue until only 1 list exists
4. Return the single merged list

Runtime beat 75%, memory 62%
