Initial thoughts:

- Had a lot of issues realising Python reads binary in little-endian rather whereas on paper I use big-endian
- Trivial question - had so many issues with not being able to debug on leetcode website and not understanding their input type
  - On initial conversion from binary to int, prepending 0s was required to make up a 32bit binary num
